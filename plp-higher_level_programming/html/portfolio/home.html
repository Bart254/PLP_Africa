			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>As you have probably guessed from the title, I'm Bartlett Omondi. This is the part where I tell
			you what you don't know. Well, I'm a man, 5'7, Kenyan and Christian by faith. I know, I overshared the
			uninteresting stuff. Here goes another, I'm currently in healthcare as a medical student. You might ask, 'Then
			what are you doing in this space?' Although I belong to the ICU, I love learning how we can realize techonology's
			potential in healthcare. The world is undergoing a CPU evolution so it's vital to know how to incorporate
			it in relevant sectors to perpetuate growth. Bartlett is just one of the many students trying to bridge this gap, or,
			rather, find the bridge connecting health and tech.</p>
